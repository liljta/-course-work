                <p>A list presenting the sources (books, websites, articles, etc.) used for exploring a particular
                    subject
                    is called a bibliography. Depending on the formatting style, it is sometimes named as “Works Cited”
                    or
                    “References”. A bibliography provides such bibliographic details about each entry as its author,
                    title,
                    publisher, publication date, etc.</p>
                <p>An annotation summarizes information provided by a specific source. In its turn, an annotated
                    bibliography presents the entry you are referring to when writing your paper and provides its brief
                    description, i.e. summary. The functions an annotated bibliography may serve depend on the type of
                    your
                    assignment. The following annotated bibliography writing tips will help you learn more about the
